# Fractals viewer
A fractal viewer in C that works, but it's a mess!

I wrote this code for fun, but there are tons of problems that need fixing before it can be used seriously. Currently, you have to change the fractal in the source code.

# Todo
- [ ] Full rebuilt
- [x] Better readme
- [ ] When you see an image add the ability to select an area to zoom in on
- [ ] Add the ability to render different qualities once a zone has been selected
